# Spotifywall
Wallpaper changes according to the album's color which is currently playing

Currently it is a lot slower than required. Not using ColorThief for the project because it gives weird colors when the album is black and white and using Pillow is a lot accurate than ColorThief but it is a lot slower.

Main thing which I have to fix is the speed. The second part is tuning the colors for albums which have a lot of colors.

Applying the wallpaper works only in Linux with swww for now.
