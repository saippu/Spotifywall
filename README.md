Wallpaper changes according to the album's color which is currently playing

Not using ColorThief for the project because it gives weird colors when the album is black and white and using Pillow is a lot accurate than ColorThief. The smaller the wallpaper the faster it is to process.

Main thing will be tuning the colors for albums which have a lot of colors.

Applying the wallpaper works only in Linux with swww for now. 

Project works best with albums which have few colors. For example TV Girl - Lovers rock and Elvis Presley - Can't help falling in with you.

Tested on:
Arch linux with Hyprland
